# Gym-Analysis-Exploration-
Project 1 for CS238 - Data exploration using pandas collaborated with Yany Martinez.

For our first unit we performed exploratory data analysis, using NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas and iPy Widgets.

Me and my peer, Yany Martinez, decided to base our project off of a simulated dataset found on Kaggle. This dataset contained information about gym members metrics, and we used this data to answer important questions.
